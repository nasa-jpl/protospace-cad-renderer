# protospace-cad-renderer

Self-contained code for rendering extremely high-fidelity processed CAD models originally developed for the [NASA JPL ProtoSpace project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD0FoH8M1EM) web viewer and companion application.

Implements techniques for incrementally updating transforms and rendering spacecraft parts, interactiving with complex hierarchies of geometries, minimizing visual impact, and compositing layers of rendered components.

**Warning**: the m2020 model in this repository is over 1.25GB.

## To Run

1. Run `npm install` in the root folder.
1. Run `npm start`.
